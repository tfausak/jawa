Type definitions for JWP events.

<https://docs.jwplayer.com/players/reference/javascript-player-api-introduction>

This package provides types along with JSON decoders (and encoders) for events
from JW Player's JavaScript player. It is meant to be used together with a port
to listen to `.on('all')` events, or any subset of those.

``` js
jwplayer().on('all', (_, data) =>
    yourApp.ports.yourPort.send(JSON.stringify(data)));
```
